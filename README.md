## Project Description
The primary objective of this project is to improve customer segmentation and facilitate personalized marketing strategies. By leveraging K-means clustering, we aim to identify distinct customer segments based on their transaction history. The resulting clusters will be used to tailor marketing efforts and promotions for each segment, providing a more personalized experience for customers.
## Data
The project utilizes transaction data with the following key features:
- `TransactionID`: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `CustomerDOB`: Customer's date of birth.
- `CustGender`: Customer's gender.
- `CustLocation`: Customer's location.
- `CustAccountBalance`: Customer's account balance.
- `TransactionDate`: Date of the transaction.
- `TransactionTime`: Time of the transaction.
- `TransactionAmount (INR)`: Amount of the transaction.
## Methods
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** The provided transaction data was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accurate and meaningful results. This included handling missing values, converting date formats, and standardizing gender values.

2. **RFM Analysis:** Calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics for each customer to facilitate segmentation.

3. **K-means Clustering:** Applied K-means clustering to group customers based on RFM scores, enabling the identification of different customer segments.

4. **Visualizations:** Created visualizations, such as line plots and bar charts, to represent the distribution of customers across different segments.

5. **Personalized Marketing Offers:** Developed personalized marketing offers for each customer segment to enhance targeted promotions. This included providing discount codes and exclusive deals based on cluster membership.

6. **Temporal Analysis:** Explored temporal patterns in transaction data to understand customer activity at different times. This involved analyzing monthly transaction totals and identifying any seasonality or recurring patterns.

7. **Feedback Loop Implementation:** Established a feedback loop to continuously evaluate the effectiveness of personalized marketing strategies. Monitored changes in customer behavior and adjusted marketing approaches accordingly.
8. ## Results
The K-means clustering analysis resulted in well-defined customer segments, each characterized by distinct RFM patterns. The project successfully provides a foundation for personalized marketing strategies tailored to the identified segments. The temporal analysis revealed insights into the seasonality of customer transactions.
